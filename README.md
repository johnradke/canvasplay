canvasplay
==========

Working demos here: http://www.johnradke.net/canvasplay/

Me learning how to use the &lt;canvas> element.

Gradually building a couple libraries as I go:

- bedrock.js is a utility class a la underscore or prototype with a little of jquery in it
- canvasproxy.js is obviously a wrapper for various &lt;canvas> operations

There are definitely better libraries already out there, but this is a good way to get to know the sort of challenges those library writers faced.

Kaleidoscope
------------

click &amp; drag to draw a path onscreen, and your drawing will be mirrored a bunch of times. did something like this once in VB6 a long time ago...

Christmas Tree
--------------

Spinning Christmas tree. Playing with faking 3D using overlapping (Z-ordering), foreshortening (squeezing the height), and shading (farther back is darker).

Tetrominoes (in progress)
-------------------------

Tetris-like game. Using grayscale kinda for the hell of it.
